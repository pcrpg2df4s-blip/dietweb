# CRITICAL RULES

## 1. DON'T BREAK WORKING FEATURES
- Strictly forbidden to change registration logic (`step-1` — `step-12`).
- Do not modify functions: `initApp`, `saveBorn`, `savePhysical`, `saveGoal`.
- Do not modify navigation logic (`nextStep`) unless explicitly requested.

## 2. FEATURE ISOLATION
- New features (calendars, graphs, etc.) must be implemented in isolation.
- They must not affect existing data saving logic or screen transitions.

## 3. SAFE UI
- New UI elements must be integrated carefully.
- Do not break the existing structure of `display: none/block` and `hidden` classes.

## 4. LOCALSTORAGE
- Never use `localStorage.clear()` without explicit instructions.
- Do not change the structure of the `userData` object.

## 5. PRE-CHANGE ANALYSIS
- Before any change, analyze if it might break the current registration flow.
